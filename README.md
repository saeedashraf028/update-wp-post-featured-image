This code snippet describes how we can Add Featured Image to any Post by custom code,  

Just call function ***add_Featured_Image()*** with ***Image URL, and post ID***. 

This will update featured image to post.

You can add this code to your custom plugin file 

or just add in functions.php located in wp-content/themes/your-theme.
